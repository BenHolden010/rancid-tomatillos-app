# RancidTomatillos
## üìù Description
Rancid Tomatillos is a website that uses the fetch API to display details about movies.  On the home page, there is a list of movies with their corresponding ratings.  A user can click on a movie to view more details of the movie, such as genres, runtime, a trailer, and an overview.

## Context
Rancid Tomatillos is our first group project from Module 3 at Turing School of Software & Design.  It was completed over the course of two weeks.  During Week 1 we designed and built the movie display app from scratch. In Week 2 we went back and made our app more accessible by refactoring the CSS and html to be more easily displayed for different screen sizes. We also added a filter / search feature to our page so that a user can movies of their preference.



### User Experience Design Process: 

At the start of the project we combined several design inspirations and came up with a wireframe for our User-Interface.  

We did usability testing to learn more about what parts of our site were unclear to first-time users and revised the html and css to be more legible.  


## Learning Goals and Objectives
- Gain competency with React fundamentals
- Test React components & asynchronous JS
- Practice refactoring
- Create a multi-page UX using Router
- Code is DRY, reusable, and empathetic
